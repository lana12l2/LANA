Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Actions speak louder than words.
All for one and one for all.
All's fair in love and war.
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. All's well that ends well.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
An apple never falls far from the tree.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Appearances can be deceiving.
April showers bring May flowers.
