Square

All the colors and personalities
you can't see right through what I truly am
you're hurting me without noticing
I'm so,so broke like someone just robbed me
I'm no invincible 
I have much memories of getting more weaker
I know I'm not loveable
but you know what you'd have to say
Come on let's go to bed
we gonna rock the night away 
who did that to you, babe
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
Come on, let's drink and have very unmanageable day
would you want me in bae
If you're not in the right mood to sleep now then
come take my arms and go 
I'll be yours for sure
